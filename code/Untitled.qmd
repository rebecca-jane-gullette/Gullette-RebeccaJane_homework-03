# Model selection

From the `MuMIn` package

```{r}
model.sel(model0,
          model1, 
          model2, 
          model3,
          model4)
```

# Problem 1. Multiple linear regression: model selection and construction

## a. Make a table or list of all the models from class and the last one you constructed on your own. Write a caption for your table.

```{r}
model_table <- modelsummary::modelsummary(
  list(
    "Null" = model0,
    "Model 1" = model1,
    "Model 2" = model2,
    "Model 3" = model3,
    "Model 4" = model4
  )
)
```

**Table 1. Comparison of Models**

```{r}
model_table
```

## b. Write a 5-6 sentence “statistical methods” section. (8 points)

Your answer should be in paragraph form and include:

how you addressed the central question(s) (i.e. to examine the influence of \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_ on \_\_\_\_\_, I…) how you chose the final model (i.e. to determine the model that best described \_\_\_\_, I…) how you visually determined that your final model conformed to the assumptions of a linear model (i.e. to evaluate linear model assumptions, I…)

```{r}
model_preds4 <- ggpredict(model4, 
                         terms = c("water_treatment", 
                                   "species_name"))

view(model_preds4)
```

c.  creating visualization

```{r}
# creating new data frame of model predictions for plotting
model_preds4_for_plotting <- model_preds4 %>% 
  rename(water_treatment = x,
         species_name = group)

ggplot() +
  # underlying data
  geom_point(data = drought_exp_clean,
             aes(x = water_treatment,
                 y = total_g,
                 color = water_treatment),
             position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),
             size = 0.8,
             alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_pointrange(data = model_preds4_for_plotting,
              aes(x = water_treatment,
                  y = predicted,
                  ymin = conf.low,
                  ymax = conf.high,
                  color = water_treatment),
              size = 0.1) +
  # cleaner theme
  labs(x = "Water Treatment", y = "Total Biomass") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),
        legend.position = "none") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Well watered" = "deepskyblue3", "Drought stressed" = "#993399")) +
  # creating different panels for species
  facet_wrap(~species_name)
```

## d. Write a caption for your visualization.

## e. Write a 3-4 sentence results section

Your answer should be in paragraph form and address the following points:

what predictors “best” described total mass (include model statistics here)? on average, what differences did you find between water treatments? on average, what differences did you find between species?

# Problem 2. Affective Visualization

Since my data is about crocheting, I want to draw the projects that I've completed in different sizes relative to the time I spent on them, with a border indicating pattern type and difficulty, and highlighted according to type of yarn. I can add little icons to indicate background activity, recipient, time of day, etc. I would like to organize them chronologically and have an additional icon with the days of the week and their frequencies indicated with shape.

b.  Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea.

    ![Affective Visualization Sketch](images/affectivesketch.jpeg)

c.  Make a draft of your visualization.

    ![Crochet Data Affective Visualization](images/affectivecrochet.jpeg)

    ![Key](images/affectivekey.jpeg)

d.  Write an artist statement.

I was very inspired by Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi’s Dear Data project and wanted to do a similar collage-type representation with icons, shapes, colors, and borders representing my data. For my visualization I used my iPad to create a drawing in Procreate with icons for each project I completed this quarter. This visualization shows how much time I spent on each project (size), what kind of yarn I used (highlight color), pattern (border), and pattern level (shape). Additionally I wanted to represent my crocheting habits throughout the week so I added the days of the week, with size representing average time spent per day and a sun icon indicating the time of day that I tended to crochet. I drew it all by hand and tried to represent the stitches and colors that I used for each project.

# Problem 3 Statistical Critique

## a. Revisit and summarize

What are the statistical tests the authors are using to address their main research question?

The authors used 3 Kruskal Wallis Tests and one U Test to address their main research question, is illegal fishing occurring in this Brazilian MPA and if so, when? The Kruskal Wallis Tests analyze average fishing vessel detections on three different temporal scales: by year, month, and quarterly. Additionally, they performed a U test to add an additional comparison of fishing vessel detections to lobster fishing season.

![Table: Fishing vessel detections within APACC yearly, month, quarterly, and according to lobster fishing season (2013-2020)](images/193statcritic.jpg)

## b. Visual clarity

How clearly did the authors visually represent their statistics in figures? For example, are the x- and y-axes in a logical position? Do they show summary statistics (means and SE, for example) and/or model predictions, and if so, do they show the underlying data?

The authors visually represented their data very clearly, everything is appropriately titled and labeled. I think that the temporal scale on the x axis and fishing detection on the y-axis is not only logical but very easy to read an understand. The charts all communicate the same message - the average fishing vessel detections and the different comparisons they use are very clear in the charts. They represent the data using box and whisker plots, so mean and standard error are included, although, the underlying data isn't included but they did add in the outliers.

## c. Aesthetic clarity

How well did the authors handle “visual clutter”? How would you describe the the data:ink ratio?

There is little to no "visual clutter" in this visualization. I think there is a high data:ink ratio because there are very few, if any aesthetic elements and all of the elements included are relevant. If anything, they could have added some color to make it more visually engaging as it is quite a mundane representation.

## d. Recommendations

What recommendations would you make to make the figure better? What would you take out, add, or change? Provide explanations/justifications for each of your recommendations.

Alternatively, if they did not represent their statistics in a figure, what kind of figure would you recommend to them? Describe the x- and y-axes, with any geometries and aesthetics (colors, etc.). Provide enough explanation such that someone would be able to create the figure you describe in code. Provide explanations/justifications for the figure you would recommend.
